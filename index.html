          The World Of The Witcher is an API which contains details of all the
          characters and besitary entries found in the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and
          also the two Expansions - Hearts Of Stones and Blood & Wine
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I have buil this for experimental purposes only and it may not be able
          to take much requests since it is being hosted on github pages
        </p>

        <p>The Witcher 3 is filled with many characters, and CD Projekt Red has done a great job in creating an extensive databse for all the charcters, and the beistary for monsters and wild animals. This api contains the details from the in game character entries and beistary entries</p>

        <p><span style="font-style: oblique">Note:</span>Some character entries may be incomplete due to the branching system of the game. Also, they may be different from your entries due to the different choices and different endings</p>
        <p>I may also have missed some quests, so please inform me if you think there are more characters who could be added</p>
